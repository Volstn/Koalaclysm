# Help Save the Koalas!
Sam is the last surviving space koala and his final martian base home is under attack by hordes of evil space aliens. It's your job to help him fight them off. 

## How can you help?
Wildlife all over Australia has been devastated from recent fires, droughts, and other weather events. With an estimated over 1 billion animals perished in Australia since September over 2019. I hope to raise awareness of the need to provide aid to Australia through this simple mobile game. Wires is the largest wildlife rescue organization in australia. I urge you to donate to help them continue their mission of preserving Australian wildlife.
